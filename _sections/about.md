# About

I thought I’d take some time to introduce myself.

Hi there! My name is Lindsey. I am a Professionally Certified Educational Therapist and an Ontario Certified Teacher. I am also trauma informed and a certified provider for Interactive Metronome and Integrated Listening Systems. I am deeply passionate about helping children who struggle to learn. I believe that all people, no matter what struggle they have or label they’ve been given, are capable of learning – because our brains can change! Intensive intervention that is individualized to meet a child’s specific needs can be a powerful tool to help them meet their potential.

I started Crossroads Education Centre in 2011 when I became an Educational Therapist. Educating a child with unique learning needs is no easy road, and I believe that the programs offered at Crossroads can change the trajectory of your child’s education. You are at a Crossroads – the journey of change is not easy or magical, but it is possible! I have witnessed this transformation over and over again. Hard work, dedication, time, and commitment are prerequisites to success, but there is hope! Each child’s journey is different, but every student is empowered more today than they were yesterday.

I have travelled this road as both an educator and a parent. Both of my children have unique learning profiles that made some aspects of learning hard. My daughter was diagnosed with reading disorder and after several years of intervention, she is now an avid reader! She still doesn’t love math, but she is developing strategies that help her be successful. My son, is twice exceptional and has dysgraphia, slow processing, and executive functioning struggles; he is now getting great marks in his first year of high school. Following an Interactive Metronome Program, he could keep up in class and his gross motor skills improved.

Education is a journey just like life is a journey. Each day is an opportunity for growing and stretching our brains! I would love to connect with you and be a part of your child’s educational journey.
