## What are LD’s?

Learning Differences, Disabilities, Difficulties

A Learning Difference is a general term for the unique and individual ways some people process information.

Learning Disabilities refer to a number of disorders which may affect the acquisition, organization, retention, understanding or use of verbal or nonverbal information. These disorders affect learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate at least average abilities essential for thinking and/or reasoning. As such, learning disabilities are distinct from global intellectual deficiency. [LDAC](https://www.ldac-acta.ca/official-definition-of-learning-disabilities/)

A Learning Difficulty impacts learning, but doesn’t necessarily qualify as a Learning Disability.

Common Learning Differences include:

- Dyslexia (Reading)

- Dysgraphia (Writing)

- Dyscalculia (Math)

- Verbal and Non Verbal Learning Disorders

- Executive Functioning

- ADHD/ADD

- Processing Speed
